# Mock API Example
This is an example Mock API for rapid front-end development. I walk through how to build this from scratch in [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.

##Quick Start
```
npm install
npm run start-mockapi
Load http://localhost:3001/users
```

##Next Steps
Generate PUT, POST, and DELETE requests against the mock API and note that changes are saved to db.json, so they're reflected on refresh like a real database exists! To see this in action, check out [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.
